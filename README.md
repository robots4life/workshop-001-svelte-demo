Start here.

**`git checkout 001-default-form-example`**

## 2.0 Default Form Example

Let's have a quick look at what a default form with `POST` as `method` does in the browser.

1. drag the `index.html` file in a browser tab, I am using Chrome.
2. open Developer Tools in Chrome
3. go to the Network tab in Developer Tools
4. submit the form
5. in the Developer Tools in the Network tab, click on index.html
6. click on Payload
7. find the submitted form values
